I am currently a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Mechanical & Industrial Engineering at Northeastern University (2021-now). My reseach interest includes theory and application of distributed optimization, such as the system dynamics of mirror descent / Riemannina gradient descent algorithms in distributed systems, federated learning and multi-agent reinforcement learning.
I am advised by Prof. Shahin Shahrampour.

I was previously a Ph.D. student in the Department of Industrial Engineering at Texas A&M University (2019-2021). Prior to that, I obtained my B.S. degree in Electrial Engineering from University of Science and Technology of China (2015-2019).
