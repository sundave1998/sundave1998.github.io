I am currently an Assistant Researcher (助理研究员) in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Tsinghua University (2025-now). I am a faculty member of the THU-C3I Lab, my current research focuses on the theory and novel applications for LLM reasoning. I am also interested in safe and robust AI systems.

I obtained my Ph.D. degree in 2025 from the Department of Mechanical & Industrial Engineering at Northeastern University (2021-2025). I am advised by Prof. Shahin Shahrampour. During my Ph.D, my research interest included theory and application of distributed optimization, such as the system dynamics of mirror descent / Riemannian gradient descent algorithms in distributed systems, federated learning and multi-agent reinforcement learning. 

I was previously a Ph.D. student in the Department of Industrial Engineering at Texas A&M University (2019-2021). Prior to that, I obtained my B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from University of Science and Technology of China (2015-2019) as a member of the School of the Gifted Young.
